# football-pushups-counter

Simple script to count the number of pushups we do during an Eagles game. My dad started doing this where if the Eagles score 7, you do 7 pushups. Then if they get a field goal, you do 10 pushups. Another touchdown is 17 pushups, and so on. 

Since the Eagles are really good, they can score close to 40 points a game and it becomes tough to track how many total pushups you've done.

Go Birds.
